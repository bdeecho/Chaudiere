Hello,

We are students from the Universit√© de Cergy-Pontoise, a french university located near Paris, currently working on a project that aims to make electronic music events into the campus.
This idea came a year ago, and we've talked extensively with university's cultural services to be sure that it would be possible.They are highly motivated about our project.

We are planning to do mix/live events, where some university DJs and producers are invited to perform, followed by a more professional DJ. This way, we would promote our university and our students, while bringing an intersting DJ in a singular place. 
We believe that it would please many people, seeing how many people from Paris were interested in a 1-hour long conference about techno.

We're planning this year to do three events, focused respectively on House/Deep House, Tech-House, and Techno, in various places of the university, with a not yet very well defined number of participants (we're thinking about 100 for the first one).

Moreover, we are Computer-Science students, and we thought that it would be intersing to stream the event. It would add more visibility to the event and the university.

The event is, as of now, free of charge and sponsored by the university.

We are aware that our project is pretty similar to your Boiler Room, obviously aimed at a much lower target audience.
